# TASK 3: 

# Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isaikumar/creditcardfraud 

# Steps to create the project:

Load the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset into your Python environment. You can use a library like Pandas to load the dataset.

Pre-process the dataset by scaling the features and handling any missing values or outliers.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Implement a classification algorithm to train your model. You can start with a simple algorithm like Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines.

Train your model using the training set.

Evaluate your model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Use your model to predict whether a new credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

Test your model by inputting new values for the features to see the predicted outcome.
